	<h1> Education and Academic Projects</h1>

As an electrical engineering student, I have honed my skills through a variety of academic projects. One of my standout achievements was the creation of an obstacle detector car during a semester project. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also my ability to apply engineering principles to real-world problems.
<br><br>
I have also developed a temperature sensor and a digital clock, demonstrating my proficiency in electronics and circuit design. Additionally, I took on the challenge of creating a university management system using C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. This project highlighted my ability to develop complex software solutions.
<br><br>
My interest in web development led me to explore this field further. I completed a comprehensive course on Coursera, covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I successfully earned certificates in these areas, solidifying my foundational knowledge in front-end web development. This skill set opened the door to exciting opportunities in the tech world.
