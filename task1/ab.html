	Hi I'm Ayesha Baig and I am a passionate and driven Electrical Engineering student and a Web Developer with a deep-rooted fascination for electronics and technology. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently strived to explore and apply my knowledge in innovative ways. My portfolio showcases my dedication to learning and my ability to tackle diverse projects in both electronics and web development.
	<br><br>
	My academic pursuit has been characterized by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and an unyielding drive to push boundaries. Electronics has always held a profound allure for me, and this fascination has propelled me to undertake a diverse array of challenging projects. Among these, a standout achievement is my semester project â€“ the creation of an obstacle detector car. This endeavor brilliantly exemplified my adeptness in harmonizing theoretical insights with practical ingenuity, a cardinal facet of the engineering discipline.
<br><br>
In addition to this milestone, I've plunged headlong into the intricacies of electronic circuitry. My creations include a temperature sensor and a meticulously designed digital clock. These undertakings weren't mere academic exercises; they mirrored my unwavering commitment to mastering the finer intricacies of electronics. Furthermore, I embraced the challenge of conceiving and crafting a university management system using the power of C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, underscoring my prowess in software development.
